# Restaurant Management System
Developing this for my school as first final year project. It shall be able to handle most of the processes that encountered while managing a restaurant like table management, reservation management, menu management etc. The project is designed as a web application with Rest API and database connectivity (PostreSQL) so it also is supposed to be able to do some statistical analysis about orders, reservations etc.
